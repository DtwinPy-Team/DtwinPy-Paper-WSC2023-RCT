# test 4.11.17.26
## Objective 

use case: RCT Publidh true. start with mirrored stations with high processing time. Then drop the processing time of one of the machine.

## Observations and Comments
The system ran for 35 minutes without physical error. The rct publish was skept tru. The process time of machine 3 was dropped from 80 to 25 seconds after 15 minutes. Before the drop, even with rct the system was alternating as the parallel machines are mirrored. The queue occupation was almost equal. After the drop of processing time, DT took two validations before updating the digital model. The model was updated to the expected processing time for machine 3. The queue occupation of zone 3 was higher than the zone 4 as RCT service started redirecting the parts towards machine 3. 5 parts in Queue 3 and 1 in Queue 4 was the queue occupation after the warm up after the drop. After the update, the machine 5 was updated to an exponential distribution. The DT was treating the exponential as normal distribution. Because of this, the machine 5 was being blocked extra 2 seconds manually to compensate for this diffference. Right before making the manual blocking, the station 1 was blocked accidentally for sometime for one part alone.
