# test 3.30.12.24
## Objective 

to test RCT with error and recover in stochastic distribution changing the process time between machine 3 and 4.

## Observations and Comments
After the validation 3 we change the process time between machine 3 and machine 4 (m3: 60 -> 35, m4: 35 -> 60). The idea would be to see if the system would recoginize this change and update the model and the RCT also change its policy. However, this change just made an impact after validation 6! After validation 15 another change was made coming back to the initial parameters. But this change the system was not able to recoginize! Besides that, the validation got 2 not expected low result around 0.7 between one in other change. Maybe the reason for that is that difference of process time for the same cluster is not higher than the delta t thresold of validation, so it was considering everything as the same!
