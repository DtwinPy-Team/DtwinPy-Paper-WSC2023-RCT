# test 4.11.19.12
## Objective 

to run the physical system with RCT publish off. Main goal is to run zone 3 and 4 with equal processing time which is equal to the average of the processing time used in the use case after the processing time drop in machine 3.

## Observations and Comments
the processing time 52.5 seconds was manually calculated by (80+25)/2. Eventhough the machine 3 and 4 had same processing time, we could notice some parts overtaking others as the transportation time of both the zones are not same. There was no error in the physical system.
