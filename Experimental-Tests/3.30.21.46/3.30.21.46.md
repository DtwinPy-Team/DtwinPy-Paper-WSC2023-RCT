Without Publishing RCT and adding a change in the process time of machine 1 and 5 for a higher one. Delta t now is 20 (10 to 40 for both)

## Observations and Comments
Simulation ran normally without RCT policy. After Validation 4 or 5, machines 5 and 1 got process time changed to 40. After 2 other validation, the system recoginized the change, and applied the model update and got it correct.
