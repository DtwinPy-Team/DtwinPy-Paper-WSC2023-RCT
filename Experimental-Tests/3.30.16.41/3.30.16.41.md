# test 3.30.16.41
## Objective 

Validation with a change in the middle of the process replacing the slower parallel machine by a faster one (decreasing the process time). It's expected that the RCT will detect this and start sending more parts in that direction

## Observations and Comments
After Validation 2 we sent a message with the new process time for machine 3 to 13 and 55 to machine 4. The system was able to recoginize the change of machine 3 very fast and the machine 4 in one or 2 validations laters. After validation 10 a new message is sent to go back to initial state, where machine 3 has 55 and machine 4 has 35. Machine 3 was corrected very fast, but to correct machine 4 it took some time around 5 validations. But even though it took some time to correct, it was clear that something was wrong, because the validation indicator was lower than 0.7 sometimes... In the end with everything balanced the system came back to the normal state and balance.
