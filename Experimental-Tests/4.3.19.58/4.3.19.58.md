# test 4.3.19.58
## Objective 

use case: without RCT publication, validation for 25 minutes. Start with mirrored stations. Increase processing time of station of station 3 after 8.5 minutes. finish test in 18.5 minutes.

## Observations and Comments
as planned, error was passed at 8.5 minutes. system stopped at 18.5 minutes. system ran without any visible errors.

The validation was never below the threshold. so, the error was not caught by the digital twin. the system performance was worse when compared to the case where there was no RCT publish.
