# test 3.29.20.40
## Objective 

to test RCT with errors in stochastic processing time. validation freq is 90s with delta_t at 25s. the error planned is to change the processing time of station 1 and station 5 to 40s each remotely by mqtt after 3 validations of run time.

## Observations and Comments
testing stopped due to lack of time in lab. errors were sent after 3 validations. test stopped after calculating fourth validation.
