# test 3.29.19.01
## Objective 

to test RCT with errors in processing time. validation freq is 90s with delta_t at 25s. the error planned is to change the processing time of station 1 and station 5 to 40s each remotely by mqtt after 120s of run time.

## Observations and Comments
the test was conducted as planned. after the change of processing time, part accumulation in both queue1 and queue5 was observed. the validation indicators started dropping after the change. the second validation indicator after the change droppped below the threshold value 0.7. The model was updated with correct values of processing times for the respective machines. After that, the validation indicator gave a good value. but, the queue occupation of those machine induced blocking in the previous machines causing change in their pprocess paramaters. This was followed by another drop in the validation indicator. later, the indicator rose back above the threshold and stayed well above the value 0.8. The test ran for nearly 20 minutes against the planned 8 minutes to further observe the twin behaviour.
