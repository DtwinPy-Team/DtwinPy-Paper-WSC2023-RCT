# test 3.29.12.31
## Objective 

to test validation with 90s frequency with delta_t 20s without publishing RCT. logic and input threshold at 0.7 and 0.7.

## Observations and Comments
test was done for 8 minutes and then stoppped manually. blocking condition on station 3 after the test to 9 parts. so, redoing test. the queue length adjustment was done because RCT have a different policy on blocking conditions of a branching station. RCT put the part in the other station if the station is blocked unlike the real system where the station 2 is blocked if any one of the station 3 or 4 is blocked.
