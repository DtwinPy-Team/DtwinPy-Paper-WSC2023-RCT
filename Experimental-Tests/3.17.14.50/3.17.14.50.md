# Test 3.17.14.50
- 5s model
- 7 pallets
- mydt = Digital_Twin(name= "5s_determ", template= True, Freq_Sync= 30, Freq_Valid= 60, Freq_Service= 10000, delta_t_treshold=40)
- Goal: testing multiple Sync with multiple pallets, testing the part 0 within a trace

### Observations
- Both system run perfectly
- Validation was seems to work
- Synch was just 5 seconds behind the physical
- Waiting for Part 0 to change was working
