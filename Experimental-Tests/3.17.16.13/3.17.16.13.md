# Test 3.17.16.13
- 5s model
- 7 pallets
- mydt = Digital_Twin(name= "5s_determ", template= True, Freq_Sync= 30, Freq_Valid= 60, Freq_Service= 10000, delta_t_treshold=40)
- Goal: testing false positives of Validation by blocking machine 3

### Observations
- Sync was not aligned in the end
- first validation gave 0.8
- We got one validation with more than 1.0
- When running without defects we got around 0.94 to 1.0
- After the failure we got around 0.9 to 0.94 and more than 1.14. In the end after blocking a lot we got 0.75
