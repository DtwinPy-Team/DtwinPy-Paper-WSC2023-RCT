# Test 3.17.11.56
- 5s model
- 6 pallets
- mydt = Digital_Twin(name= "5s_determ", template= True, Freq_Sync= 30, Freq_Valid= 60, Freq_Service= 10000, delta_t_treshold=40)
- Goal: testing multiple Sync with multiple pallets

### Observations
- We lost one of the traces because finished and Started was exatcly from the same timestamp -> Increase the delay between finish and start for 1 second
- We had some part 0 stuck in the system, this most probably happened because the database didn't had time enough to update the part id before the sync -> Before running sync, the system verifies if there is any part 0. If there is it waits for a while and try it again 
- This part 0 also caused a bug in validation
