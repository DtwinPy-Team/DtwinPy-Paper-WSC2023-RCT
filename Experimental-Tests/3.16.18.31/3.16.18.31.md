## Initial Observation before testing
- Problem: The power suplly for 3 ESPs was not working. Most probably because of power supply. Solution implemented: changing the power supply.

- Problem: The MQTT channel was overloaded by many massages. SOlution: Stop sending multiples messages for each reading, increase the process time

- EV3 didnot show any error when the RFID reader didnot share a part id. EV3 was using previous part id repeatedly which went unoticed. Solution: if EV3 does not get a part id, it send value "0".

## Test 3.16.18.31
- Run on 5s Model
- number of pallets: 3

### Observation
- Digital twin was a little bit behind than the physical because it waited for a while until it get a net started trace after the end time
- Changing the sensor from color detection to reflect (infrared) showed a good improvement in sensing the part prescence accurately and reduce sending ghost traces (traces that didnt actually happen in the real system) to the database.
