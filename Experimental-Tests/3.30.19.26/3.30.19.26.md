# test 3.30.19.26
## Objective 

Normal test without publishing RCT, but with delta_t_treshold= 20. Trying to push validation until the limit

## Observations and Comments
Just a normal simulation with alternating policy but validation with delta t of 20 seconds. We notice that in the exit of machine 3 a part got stuck and also for some reason all the ev3 disconnected.
