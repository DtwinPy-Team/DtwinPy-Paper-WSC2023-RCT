# Test 3.17.18.19
- 5s model
- 7 pallets
- mydt = Digital_Twin(name= "5s_determ", template= True, Freq_Sync= 30, Freq_Valid= 60, Freq_Service= 10000, delta_t_treshold=21)
- Goal: testing  false positive validation. Stoping the blocking sensor of machine to increase the process time
### Observations
- first validation got .83
- second validation was weird
- validation was between 0.9 and 1.0 before blocking
- Got error of negative process time after holding for almost more than 35 seconds
