# test 3.30.10.49
## Objective 

to test RCT with error in stochastic process time. machine 1 and 5 changed process time to 40 after 3 validations

## Observations and Comments
Running test of validation with stochastic distributions. After 3 validation it was introduced a depreciation for machine 1 and 5 to 40 seconds. Validation 4 recognized the error and updated the model, after this all the validation got correct.After validation 9 it was introduced a new change in the process time, changing to original values (M1: 11, M5: 10). The validation 10 see the error and correct the model. Another test was to see the sequence of pallets IDs been finished and check if that order keeps constant while running the RCT. The order after correcting both errors was [1,2,4,3,7,6,5,8,10,12,9,11] and this order keep following in the system, showing that the RCT was correct and functional when the system is stabilized.
