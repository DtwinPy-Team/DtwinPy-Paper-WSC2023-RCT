# test 3.30.14.01
## Objective 

to test RCT when the faster machine after the branch becomes more slower than the previous slower machine. The RCT (after model update) should be able to recognize and change the allocation.

## Observations and Comments
In this experiment we run some couple of validation without any change and than (after validation 3) we increase the process time of machine 4 to 75, so it become the slower machine after the branch. Ideally the system should be able to update the model and the RCT start sending parts to the other queue, but we notice some decreasing in the validation indicator but only once it got lower than the threshold. Even the threshold was activated the model didn't updated the process time of machine 4, it update the process time of other machines, but not relevant. It didn't updated machine 4 because it didn't had enough time to got a complete trace for that machine (within the same validation get the start and finish trace of machine 4). Given that it's like the system knows that something is wrong, but don't know where... This should be fix by increasing the period of validation. The period should be something like 0.35 higher than the max process time. Other approach would be to instead of increase, decrease the process time and simulate a scenario where you got a brand new machine...
