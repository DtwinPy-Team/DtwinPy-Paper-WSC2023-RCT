# test 3.24.09.16
## Objective

test synchronization without RCT service

## Observations and Comments
the test ran good for long time with a sync frequency of 2s. It was possible to see a lot of parts being accumulated in the queue3 which eventually blocks the station 2. This causes starvation for station 4. Overall system efficiency was not good.
