# Test 3.17.18.19
- 5s model
- 7 pallets
- mydt = Digital_Twin(name= "5s_determ", template= True, Freq_Sync= 30, Freq_Valid= 60, Freq_Service= 10000, delta_t_treshold=21)
- Goal: testing  positive validation. Change validation indicator to divede by min again and stoping for some for times the parts entering in themachine 3
### Observations
- first validation got .83
- Sync was mainly working fine but in the end got messy, maybe because we're adding randomly the parts blocks back to system
- Validation in the beginning was right 
- After the blocking we start getting some wrong validation more than 1.0 (even 1.25, 1.35) and some time lower validation (0.75, 0.35, 0.8)
- Note: even with the block some times we got 1.0, maybe because the Sync was correcting the model for Validation and it was being considered only the part of the system without problem (since we take sessions of trace and not the whole system)
- In the end the esp32 of machine 2 didn't worked
