# test 3.29.10.41
## Objective 

to warm up system with syhcronisation test with RCT pulish (queue position 1).

## Observations and Comments
towards the end, the parts were manually blocked in queue1 to check the sequence of parts in the syste. the sequence was: [5,4,7,8,9,11,10,1,12,2,3,6]. some parts overtook the previous one at the converging stations as the difference in stochastic process times of station3 and station 4 came very close to 17 which was the mean processing time of station 2.
