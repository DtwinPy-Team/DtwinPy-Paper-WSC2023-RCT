# test 3.23.15.18
## Objective

 Test with 12 parts in Queue1 with RCT Off. This could be used as a sample test to be used as a comparison for test with RCt on.

## Observations and Comments
Test was conducted successfully without any error in the physical system. The dugutal twin timedout towards the end due to lack of traces. But this would not impact the system as the RCT service was off and there was no requirement of decision making.
