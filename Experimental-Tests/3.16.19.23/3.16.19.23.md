---- Digital Twin killed at 16 March 19:21:22 ----
```
### Observation
- Digital twin was a little bit behind. Because it was looking for start trace for the start pointer
- BUG: start pointer always adding one even when it was not the same id as the previous end pointer. Could be rectified by making a check if the start pointer is landing on tbe previous end pointer. If yes, it sips one trace ahead. Or else, it doesnt. 
- Validation indicator for logic and input is 1.0 and 1.0
- validatio values looks good
- The test was terminated after two synchronisation for verification.
- THe comparison of terminal output with the real database and the picture of the real system looks good.
